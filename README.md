## My process

My process was to start with the mobile layout first and the add a media query to handle the transition to desktop.  I started with getting the image to display correctly, then I just worked down the page, getting each section to display the way the design showed.  Once the mobile layout was finished, I started the same flow on the desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that mobile first development works really well and Flexbox is a very powerful tool.  


### Continued development

Since this was my first exercise on the Fronend Mentor site, I went with CSS and HTML to keep things easy.  In the future, I plan on implementing React.js and Sass to work on those skills.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is the best resource that I have found for Flexbox, it has everything you need in a very nicely presented way.
